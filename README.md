# Air-Pollution-Forecasting

Part of my AIML CA2 assignment. The objective was to forecast the volume of 4 types of gases (CO, HC, NO2, O3) over a period of time. The assignment was set in a form of a competition on kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/aiml-2223s1/overview). We were ranked based on the RMSE of our predictions and the actual data.

### What I have learnt:
1. How time series models can use exogenous variables to better predict the values of the endogenous variables.
2. How to use different time series models
3. What tests to use to determine the effectiveness of the time series models.
